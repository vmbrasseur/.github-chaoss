In CHAOSS, we help people better understand the health of the open source communities that they care about. As open source is now a critical part in nearly everything we do, understanding the health of open source communities is really important. Thanks for checking us out!

# Finding Your Way

Joining an open source project can be overwhelming. In CHAOSS, there are a few key things to know about the project that might help you find your way: 

1) We develop metrics. The metrics are developed in different working groups that focus on different things like diversity, equity, and inclusion within an open source project, the risks associated with an open source project, and the evolution that projects might go through. 
2) We develop software. The software is developed in different groups - GrimoireLab and Augur. Both GrimoireLab and Augur are open source software tools that help display the CHAOSS metrics. 
3) We develop programs. The programs include our DEI Event Badging Program and our Metrics Model program. Both of these programs help bring select sets of metrics together to help people get a better understanding of open source community health.
